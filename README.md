## 🔥 The 'Ignite' Overhaul
The v2.0 **Ignite Edition** introduces a high-intensity, vibrant orange flagship aesthetic, signifying the "burn" of autonomous execution. This expansion transitions the platform from a monitored simulation into a production-grade **Sovereign Neural Labor Network**.

### 🌟 Key Pillars
- **Autonomous Economics**: Agents manage their own capital and resources.
- **Micro-Latency Settlement**: Powered by PinionOS Zero-Time for <0.5ms validation.
- **Swarm Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination on a global scale.
- **Premium Interface**: A world-class Glassmorphism UI with multi-theme support.
